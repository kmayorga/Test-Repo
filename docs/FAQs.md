## Glossary

**Computer Adaptive Testing**: A Computer Adaptive Test adapts to the studentsâ€™ responses. Once a student starts the assessment questions get easier or harder according to performance, and when the computer has enough information to generate a final Quantile measure, the assessment stops. 

**Common Core State Standards**: The Common Core State Standards is a set of learning standards that provide a clear and consistent understanding of what students are expected to learn throughout the school year. The standards are designed to provide teachers and City Year AmeriCorps members with a guideline of what skills and knowledge students need, so that they can prepare students for success in the classroom.
